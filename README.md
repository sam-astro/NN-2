# NN-2
Most advanced versions of my Unity based Neural Networks, completing many learning tasks better than before, and now with a feature to use backpropagation.

## **The main branch does not have a functioning network. The best functioning networks are [`walker-2.0`](https://github.com/sam-astro/NN-2/tree/walker-2.0), [`pole-cart`](https://github.com/sam-astro/NN-2/tree/pole-cart), and [`grabber-arm-2D`](https://github.com/sam-astro/NN-2/tree/grabber-arm-rail). To use them, just switch to the desired branch and clone it.**
