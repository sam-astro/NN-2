# NN-2
Most advanced versions of my Unity based Neural Networks, completing many learning tasks better than before, and now with a feature to use backpropagation.

> **The main branch does not have a functioning network. The best functioning networks are `walker-2.0`, `pole-cart`, and `grabber-arm-2D`. To use them, just switch to the desired branch and clone it.**
